# Eco_Donate
<h3>Project description.</h3>
This Project is about how to reduce global horming in this mordernized days. When we talk about "Gloabal Worming" it simply means the rise in global temperatures due mainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And this causes "Climate Change". Climate change refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time â€“ including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns.
To help reduce this "Global Worming", one thing we could do is to plant trees. 
So we brought up an idea to make donation to help reduce global worming to help the environment.
